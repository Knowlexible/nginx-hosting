          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above photo displays the process of how my design was altered throughout our project. 
          <ul>
            <li><b>Stage 1</b> there was focus on following the general layouts of the app overall.</li>
            <li><b>Stage 2</b> was the design that occurred after implementing our code into Adobe XD and testing the application by turning the parts of the design into assets.</li>
            <li><b>Stage 3</b> was the final design that came from our goal.</li>

        <b>The Outcome:</b>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final outcome of the application there were five activities that would occur when the user opened our application. First, they would be brought to a login page where they would enter their necessary credentials. Once entering their data they would then click the login button which would then bring them to the screen displayed next where they would choose a circle button of what exactly they were looking for. Once choosing their interest it would bring them to the main activity as seen above on the right where it would display a randomized url. If the user wanted to change their choice again then they would be brought to the two middle activities on the right.

Due to the animal having a thick coat, I decided on placing it in a cold environment on the mountains. To help better the overall look of the creature, I decided to place a blue tint on top of the animal to help blend it in by messing with the transparency tool.</p>

                  I was the Marketing/Advertising Chair for project Thanks4Giving in which I was in charge of nine other members and had to work with four other chairs (e.g. financing, baking, blood drive, and project manager). I was also in charge of designing flyers and these were the two finalized designs that my team approved as well as the rest of the other teams. My duties included having to keep attendance, host meetings for discussions and assigning tasks to my team members. </p>

                <p class="card-text">I would create random shapes using the line tool and place them on top of each other seeing what design would work best. The most difficult part would have to be layering the shapes as many of the shapes are fluid. The design reminds me of camo print.
                 As for future projects similar to this one, I would say that I would try doing the piece in a variety of colors to experiment which color combinations would work best with one another.</p>

During the time that I made this composition I was still obsessed with the movie, "La La Land" so that influenced the composition overall. In order to make the letter appear shaded, I used a series of l's and vertically placed them on each of the big letters to make them pop.</p>
